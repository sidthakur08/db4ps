There is only a small amount of health and Mir is quickly overwhelmed. While sneaking enemies can be distracted using noise bombs, smoke bombs, chakrams as a throwing weapon, for instance to slice ropes from a distance, or by whistling. Sneaking is usually done based on line of sight, shown as a cone, but certain sections also have noisy floors where only slow movement is allowed. It is possible to hide in alcoves and steal from enemies if they are not watching. Loot provides additional ammo, keys or documents. Enemies can be choked with a non-lethal takedown and the bodies can be dragged to a different location. Mir can also use a grappling hook to hoist himself up. Tigers and birds play an important role as they can alert many guards at once. Once detected a timer counts down before every guard involved returns from a 'panicked/alerted' to an 'investigative' state, providing a small amount of time for Mir to find a safe spot.\r\n\r\nJust like the first game the player is rated based on how well stealth is applied. The level score combined with style bonuses unlocks perks and new abilities. Optionally chests with items can be opened and Animus shards can be collected. Next to the main game, divided into multiple levels with checkpoints and story sequences in between, there are separate missions in the Challenge Room section, based on three types: Assassinations, Collect and Contracts."}, {"Name": "Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "February 9, 2016", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "", "Developers": "\nThe Climax Group ", "Publishers": "\n", "Genres": "\nPlatform, Stealth ", "Max Players": "1", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "3.75", "Total View": "6", "Wikipedia": "", "Video Link": "", "Overview": "Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia is the third game in the Assassin's Creed Chronicles trilogy, a spin-off of based on the main Assassin's Creed franchise. After China and India as settings in the previous games, this one is set in Russia in 1918. Nikola\u00ef Orelov is tasked by the Brotherhood to retrieve a mysterious box from the family of the Tsar, who are held captive by the Bolsheviks. During his mission, he saves the young Duchess Anastasia, who reveals surprising and mysterious powers. Nikola\u00ef realizes that the Duchesses life will be sacrificed if delivered to his own order. He must choose between protecting the innocent life of a surrogate daughter, becoming the marked man by both the Templars and the Assassins, or getting his hands dirty for the greater good.\r\n\r\nJust like the previous titles it is a 2.5D side-scrolling game that mixes a stealth approach with combat, solving small environmental puzzles along the way and using a variety of gadgets and weapons. Unlike in the previous two games, Orelov relies on his rifle with a mounted bayonet instead of a sword, but the effect is the same as he can perform a stealth kill, strike with it, jump kill, and additionally he can fire at the enemy which doesn't require of him to carry throwing knives or chakram as assassins from earlier ear. Bullets, as well as other gadgets and ammo that needs to be resupplied can be found in containers or by looting an enemy guard. New equipment for Orelov includes a winch which lets him pry open various locks and gates by firing a grappling hook at it and pulling it quickly a few times. Additionally, the winch can send an electrical discharge to deactivate electrical traps. Hiding behind covers or in alcoves, using smoke bombs for distraction, performing map synchronization in places from which a leap of faith can be performed in order to display the location of secret items on the map, and general movement in all six directions is done in almost the same way as in previous two games. And just as before, as the story progresses, different, more elite types of soldiers will enter the scene. They will be able to perform different kinds of attacks as well as defend against certain types of Orelov's moves, for example soldiers wearing gas masks cannot be affected by smoke bombs, or soldiers wearing armor cannot be harmed by bullets. Weapons and warfare are shaped to fit the timeline and as such there may be new obstacles to encounter, such as land mines which are deactivated when a guard is crossing them, leaving you a close window to sneak past unnoticed, or kill the guard and just carry him on your back while crossing over the mine. The sniping which was briefly introduced near the end of the previous game, is heavily emphasized here and you can perform it using your own rifle at specified sniper nests. During sniping the game shifts to a 1st-person perspective and allows you to zoom in on your target. Sniping sequences doesn't cost the player any bullets despite the use of the same rifle. Certain guards may be out of sight or in a group which makes it impossible to pass the level without distracting them first. This can be done by shooting anywhere near them in order to get them to investigate the place of the bullet ricochet.\r\n\r\nAfter Orelov saves Anastasia, the game takes a turn unlike to that of its predecessors, giving the players two characters to control. Due to an unknown phenomenon which occurs when the mysterious box comes in touch with Orelov's necklace, Anastasia occasionally gets possessed by Shao Jun, the protagonist from Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China which turns her into a deadly assassin and slowly starts to affect the real Anastasia by turning her from prey into a huntress. While the player cannot control the characters simultaneously or switch at will, both characters are interchangeably controllable throughout the story, often providing assistance and covering fire to one another."}, {"Name": "Assassin's Creed III: Remastered", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "March 29, 2019", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "", "Developers": "\nUbisoft Divertissements Inc.

King Leonidas I of Sparta and his army of 300 stop the advance of an invading Persian army that counts tens of thousands soldiers. In the end, he falls, but not before costing the Persians so dearly that their conquest for Greece fails on the very shore they landed. Two generations later, Alexios and Kassandra were born. Depending on player's selection, one of them plays the protagonist while the other becomes an antagonist. But before they were shaped into mighty warriors, they were children, they were Spartan, and one of them was to be sacrificed to the gods at the behest of the Cult of Kosmos who works in the shadows yet controls the world through chaos. Many years later, the remaining sibling lives on the island of Kephallonia, while the other is presumed dead by being thrown from the mountain in the sacrificial process. The protagonist living in Kephallonia was rescued and raised by Markos, a shady character with a knack of making drachmae and getting himself into trouble, but with a good heart. Being raised by such a person made the protagonist took a path of becoming a mercenary. Feeling ready, it was time to venture into the world and find the answer to many questions that troubled the protagonist from the childhood. Why did their father allow the sacrifice? Is the mother still alive? Who or what is the Cult of Kosmos and what are their plans? Thus, Alexios' or Kassandra's odyssey begins.\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\n\r\nThis is the the first time in the series where the player gets to choose the protagonist. In Syndicate player could switch between sibling protagonists, but here the entire story is shaped around the single selectable protagonist, Alexios or Kassandra. The game also has two main gameplay modes... one which helps the player by showing where to go next for main quests, and the exploration mode which forces the players to explore Ancient Greece on their own and find out where the next goal is on their own. Similar to previous games in the series, the player can move on foot, ride a horse, or commandeer a ship (or a smaller fishing boats that will break on open sea on big waves). Many RPG elements were taken directly from Origins so the player has various weapons and armor which can be replaced or upgraded by the blacksmith. Weapons and armors can also be engraved with special abilities. As with other RPGs, there is a leveling up system in this game, but the enemy levels up together with the player so while the player's attack, defense and overall strength increases, the same happens to the enemies so player never becomes strong enough to more easily or more quickly take out some fortress or a pack of wolves head on. Weapons and armor too have a level number assigned, but each piece of equipment can be upgraded to player's current level with enough money and resources. Money is earned by doing mercenary jobs, weather story quests or various tasks which constantly appear on the bulletin boards in towns and ports. Experience points are earned by defeating enemies, solving quests and opening new regions and areas on the map. Experience points are used to level up which in turn lets the player exchange skill points to upgrade existing or unlock new skills. After a while, additional upgrade system opens which lets the player use skill points to upgrade warrior, ranger, or assassin type of attacks. Spent skill points can be reset at any time and re-used for entirely new selection. While the player is a mercenary and he gets paid for various jobs and bounties, doing bad things in the open may create a bounty on player's head which will make other mercenaries hunt the player. Bounty can be lifted by remaining out of sight for a while, by paying money for your crimes, or by killing those that put bounty on your head. The quests are split into odyssey quests which are quests tied to the main story, add-on quests which are related to DLCs, world & characters which are quests given by characters you met on your travel, and bounties & contracts which are acquired from various bulletin boards. By completing the main story quests, the game doesn't pause or asks the player if they wish to continue exploring, it simply continues as if they were regular quests. End credits roll doesn't kick in, though credits can be accessed via main menu. A photo mode is available and lets the player post a photo online which appears on the part of the map where it was taken. The same way, player can look at other cool photos taken and posted by other players. Entirely new in this game and further step toward role-playing game are selectable dialogues and topics to talk about. Even choices which can be used in dialogues without having to unlock such ability like in other RPGs, for example choosing the approach to get some answer... through intimidation or seduction. There are also many romances (although none really deeper than one-night stand) which can be followed through based on dialogue selection and actions done in a specific quest. But even though sex element is introduced, nothing more than flirting dialogues that lead to a kiss which then fades into black screen is shown.\r\n\r\nLand Combat & Controls:\r\n\r\nWhile Ancient Greece has many island and is surrounded by sea, most of exploration will still be done on land. While on foot, the player can walk, run or sneak while crouching. Sneaking reduces the chance to be spotted, and if the player is in the bushes then unless the enemy soldier bumps into you, the player is invisible which is indicated by slightly highlighting the player character. There are many different weapons the player can wield, from swords and hammers to spears and tridents, each weapon has its own pros and cons, power and speed. Only two weapon types can be selected at the same time for a quick switch during combat. Close combat weapons are warrior weapons. For long ranged attacks the player uses bow and arrow. There are different types of arrows and different skill moves and powers can be assigned for both warrior and ranger style attacks. Assassin skills and assassin attacks are used only when the enemy is unaware of the player, meaning when you sneak up to or run to the enemy looking in the opposite direction. There is literally no limit to where the player can climb and after reaching certain level, jumping from skies won't harm you either. World map is initially covered and it shows various locations, towns, fortresses, bandit camps, and other points of interest by entering new region. Synchronization points are still there and once reached they can be used for fast-travel, otherwise the horse really speeds up the travel as opposed to running, although in vicinity of towns even the horse won't be fully galloping. To upgrade equipment or craft arrows and other things, resources are needed. They vary from tree branches to metal ore and are scattered around the land, re-spawning upon entering the same area, and same happens to cleared forts and soldier camps.\r\n\r\nSea Combat & Controls:\r\n\r\nThere are small fishing boats which are fast and useful for reaching close islands or navigating across the shallow water with no big waves, and then there is the main ship, the Adrestia, that players can upgrade and uses to battle enemy ships and travel the open sea. The ship can be upgraded in appearance (both ship itself and the crew) as well as in strength. When fighting other vessels, archers fire at longer distance while javelins fire at closer. Additionally, ramming an enemy ship from the side causes massive damage and can sometime break the enemy ship in half. When damaged enough, the enemy ship can also be boarded and plundered. Most of weapons and armor can be sold and disassembled for parts, but epic equipment cannot. If it clutters the menu with many old epic pieces of armor or weapons, those can be stored in a chest on the player's ship. Bulletin board with contracts and bounties can also be accessed on the ship. But sea combat and exploration isn't limited to surface alone... the player can dive the entire sea and explore the underwater life just as well. While underwater, holding your breath leaves a short amount of time to dive leisurely, but there is a trident weapon which when equipped gives the player the ability to breathe underwater so exploring underwater ruins and fighting sharks can be done without having to worry about the remaining air in your lungs.\r\n\r\nAir Combat & Controls:\r\n\r\nThere isn't really any type of combat that takes place in the air, but there is a controllable character that is non-stop in the air, namely Ikaros, the player's faithful eagle. While in the open, the player can switch to Ikaros at any time and check the surrounding from high up in the air. Ikaros can tag enemy for the player which is the main purpose of this bird, although it can soar on its own and explore more distant areas. Synchronizing map points also adds a brief cutscene showing Ikaros circling around the checkpoint and giving the open view of the area. By level up the player character, as well as synchronizing more checkpoints, Ikaros too gains new abilities such as being able to see and mark targets further, come down and swoop nearby animals or even be called on to distract enemies."}, {"Name": "Assassin's Creed: Odyssey: Legacy of the First Blade", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "December 4, 2018", "Game Type": "DLC", "ESRB": "", "Developers": "\nUbisoft Quebec ", "Publishers": "\nUbisoft ", "Genres": "\nAction, Adventure, Role-Playing ", "Max Players": "1", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "5", "Total View": "2", "Wikipedia": "", "Video Link": "", "Overview": "Fight alongside the legend who first wielded the Hidden Blade, and change the course of history, while learning why the Assassins chose to fight from the shadows.

Each world introduces new elements such as multiple groups of trucks driving in different directions, gaps, moving structures, time limits, swinging hammers, flamethrowers, lasers, cannons shooting trucks and so on.

While the main levels are always identical, because of the physics and player actions the gameplay is never completely the same.\r\n\r\nBased on speed and style, points are earned. These can be used to unlock movement and utility abilities. Only one of each can be equipped at all times. Movement abilities are air dash, disrespected blink (teleportation), double jump, grappling hook, jetpack, levitation, truck boost, and trucker flip. The utility abilities are back truck, epic mode, portable truck (a projectile that spawns a truck to land on), supertruck, time slow, and trucksolute zero (freezes all trucks). Each ability has a recharge time.\r\n\r\nThere is an in-game editor and integration with the Steam Workshop to create and share levels with other users. The best times can be compared on global leaderboards. There is Twitch streaming integration with audience participation where viewers can vote for events in real-time.

Players have the ability to drive from coast to coast with the inclusion of major cities such as Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami and New York, as well as specific locales such as Pikes Peak, the Laguna Seca race track, famous landmarks such as Cape Canaveral, many highways and smaller towns. In the single-player campaign the player controls Alex Taylor. He is a witness to the murder on his brother Datton, the leader of a crew called the 5-10's, but is arrested himself. Five years later he is given the opportunity by the FBI to hunt down his brother's killer Dennis 'Shiv' Jefferson, the gang's leader, as he is deployed to unmask the corrupt FBI agent Coburn who is also involved. He has to join the crew himself and make a name for himself to rise up the ranks.\r\n\r\nThe missions consist of a large amount of races and cut-scenes further the story, but there are also smaller challenges called 'skills' such as slalom courses, staying on the ideal racing line, making big jumps to cross gaps and maintaining a certain speed for a set distance. Skills are triggered by driving through them. Next to regular checkpoints races against the clock or opponents there are specific tasks such as stealing a certain car, transporting packages, escaping from cops, performing takedowns or chauffeuring. As Taylor rises up the ranks and get tasks from the crew's tiers V, V2, V4, V6 and eventually V8, new areas open up. The entire world is available right away, but the missions in the areas to the west only open up when a certain level has been reached and events usually recommend a car of a certain level.\r\n\r\nCars do not need to follow roads and can generally race on any type of terrain. There are specs for each type of environment that enhance performance, such as Circuit, Dirt, Performance, Raid and Street, but not all cars have access to all of them. The game world uses a day-and-night cycle and a large map can be used to plan a route with navigation. Taylor gains experience to level up and the same applies to the cars. Regularly new car parts are supplied, often based on his performance, to upgrade the car. With each new level perks become available, used to give Taylor an experience boost or to further enhance the cars.\r\n\r\nNext to the solo parts players can join crews to share the experience, work together and progress quicker. Crews of up to four people can form temporarily alliances with online players or with friends. Up to eight players are supported simultaneously in a single session. After the initial of the parts factions become available, such as the Eagles on the East Coast and the Wolves in the Midwest. Players get to join a certain faction to access PvP and PvE races. Joining a crew is the only way to earn crew credits, a secondary currency to buy perks and cars. The game supports microtransactions with real money to buy cars, but you cannot acquire any above your current level. This is never required to progress in the game. Crew credits can also be bought as large credits packs.\r\n\r\nEach crew has a crew leader who can take a number of decisions, such as restarting a mission. There is also a large amount of social features to track scores and compare with friends. The game contains many types of cars from licensed manufacturers such as Aston Martin, Bentley, BMW and Ferrari. After the main game has been completed and level 50 is hit, platinum car parts can be obtained, as opposed to the gold ones, encouraging players to continue racing as these provide a random statistics boost to get the best possible car for PvP matches at the highest level."}, {"Name": "Croixleur Sigma", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "January 19, 2016", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "Developers": "\nSouvenir Circ.

It is set in the same universe as Eternity's Child and it is very similar to the earlier titles Mecho Wars and the remake Mecho Wars HD by the same development team and many characters from those games return. Just like in Mecho Wars two factions known as Winged Crusade and Landians fight over land and resources. The single-player campaign is split up in three episodes with multiple levels each, in-game story sequences with events and conversations between characters.\r\n\r\nThe turn-based battles combine fights with resource management. Different types of buildings such as factories and cities can be captured by infantry. Once captured, they generate an amount of gold per turn that can be used at those locations to train new units. They are divided into four types: infantry, heavy, air and water with multiple units per type. They each have a cost and different statistics based on movement, attack range, an offensive bonus against certain types and a weakness against certain types. Slower and heavy units can often attack from a distance and take a lot of damage, but movement is slow and they are weak against certain types. During a turn the player can move units, train new ones, capture buildings and attack. For movement a green grid shows the available options.\r\n\r\nThere terrain also influences the gameplay. A road and a bridge lower the defenses, but improves movement, while a mountain extends the attack range. There are flying units that can travel anywhere and water units that can cross large gaps and attack from a distance. Cacti are used to replenish health. The game uses a day-and-night system with an hour per turn. At night, water freezes and units have the ability to travel over the ice. In the story campaign there are different win conditions, but usually opponents need to be defeated and buildings need to be captured. Once captured they change colour, but the opponent can also retake them. Buildings can only be captured by fast, but weak infantry units. Battles are shown in a separate screen with a side view and are executed automatically. The attack is shown as well as the damage done to the opposition, with two large health bars near the top. Before attacking a percentage of success is shown at the targeted unit. A single unit almost always represents a larger group and some creatures have the ability to retaliate right away.\r\n\r\nIn the skirmish game mode custom battles in all levels are available. They are played as games of Conquest (capture all H.Q. structures) or Annihilation (defeat all enemies). Online multiplayer is supported with an additional game type, Assassination, where a specific, marked creature needs to be defeated to win the game. For multiplayer games a turn time can be defined as 5 or 20 minutes, or 8 or 24 hours. Multiple games can be played at the same time, in both single-player and multiplayer and these can be accessed right away from a menu by clicking a snapshot of the area. The game also includes unlockable perks to customize the armies."}, {"Name": "Destiny", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "September 9, 2014", "Game Type": "", "ESRB": "M - Mature", "Developers": "\nBungie ", "Publishers": "\nActivision ", "Genres": "\nAction, Shooter ", "Max Players": "4", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "3.5", "Total View": "3", "Wikipedia": "", "Video Link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2Jx5__c1lY", "Overview": "From the creators of Halo and the publisher of Call of Duty comes Destiny.

It was released worldwide in October 2012 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Set in the fictional, plague-ridden industrial city of Dunwall, Dishonored follows the story of Corvo Attano, bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles. He is framed for her murder and forced to become an assassin, seeking revenge on those who conspired against him. Corvo is aided in his quest by the Loyalists\u2014a resistance group fighting to reclaim Dunwall, and the Outsider\u2014a powerful being who imbues Corvo with magical abilities. Several noted actors including Susan Sarandon, Brad Dourif, Carrie Fisher, Michael Madsen, Lena Headey, and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz provided voice work for the game.\r\n\r\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective and allows the player to undertake a series of assassination missions in a variety of ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions can be completed through stealth, combat, or a combination of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are changed in response to the player's violent actions or lack thereof. Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.\r\n\r\nDuring its three years in production, several versions of Dishonored were developed. Before the creation of Dunwall\u2014inspired by late nineteenth-century London and Edinburgh\u2014the game was set to take place in medieval Japan and seventeenth-century London. During development, test players discovered methods of exploiting the available powers and abilities to achieve unexpected outcomes; instead of restricting these techniques, the designers attempted to redesign levels to accommodate them. Dishonored\u200a'\u200bs music score was produced by composer Daniel Licht to represent London in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nDishonored received generally positive reviews, focusing on the missions' individual narratives and the freedom available in completing them. Criticism fell on the overarching narrative, which was considered predictable, and problems in controlling the player's character. Following its release, the game won several awards, including the 2012 Spike Video Game award for Best Action-Adventure Game and the 2013 BAFTA award for Best Game, and was repeatedly recognized as the best action-adventure game of 2012 and one of that year's best games. Following its release, Dishonored was supplemented with additional content focusing on the assassin Daud and his quest for redemption. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game were released in August 2015. A sequel, Dishonored 2, was announced in June 2015."}, {"Name": "Disney Infinity: 2.0 Edition", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "September 23, 2014", "Game Type": "", "ESRB": "E - Everyone", "Developers": "\nAvalanche ", "Publishers": "\nDisney Interactive Studios ", "Genres": "\nSandbox ", "Max Players": "4", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "4.67", "Total View": "6", "Wikipedia": "", "Video Link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1P3b4YU8so", "Overview": "Heroes and villains.

The game was initially released via Valve's Steam software for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on April 23, 2013. A PlayStation 4 port became available the following year (with PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3 versions released on September 2014 and June 2015 respectively), and further versions for Xbox One, iOS and mobile phones are under consideration.[1] Downloadable content titled Reign of Giants was released on April 30, 2014, and a multiplayer expansion called Don't Starve Together became free for existing users on June 3, 2015.[2]\r\n\r\nThe game follows a scientist named Wilson who finds himself in a dark, dreary world and must survive as long as possible. Toward this end, the player must keep Wilson healthy, fed, and mentally stable as he avoids a variety of surreal and supernatural enemies that will try to kill and devour him. The game's \"Adventure\" mode adds depth to the sparse plot and pits Wilson against the game's antagonist, Maxwell.\r\n\r\nDon't Starve was Klei's first foray into the survival genre. Conceived during the height of a game industry trend of dropping players into a world with few instructions and a goal of survival, the game was influenced by Minecraft, which spearheaded this trend, as well as by filmmaker Tim Burton. The game received positive reviews from critics; commended for its original art style, music, and variety of ways for the player to die, although its high level of difficulty and implementation of permanent death were less warmly received.\r\n\r\nDon't Starve is an action-adventure game with a randomly generated open world and elements of survival and roguelike gameplay.[3][4][5][6] Combat is handled by pointing and clicking with the mouse,[4] while other activities are controlled by the keyboard, or using the inbuilt gamepad support to play using a controller, giving it a console-like gameplay feel.[7] The goal is to survive as long as possible, with a count of the number of days the player has survived shown onscreen. The game keeps few records of player progress besides the total number of experience points and the playable characters unlocked. Wilson is the main playable character, but the first character, Willow, can be unlocked with 160 experience points\u2014the player earns 20 each in-game day and receives them after dying\u2014while Woodie, the last, requires the game's limit of 1,600.[4][8] As is common among roguelikes, death is permanent, barring the use of several rare and difficult to acquire items, like the Meat Effigy, Touch Stone, and Life Giving Amulet.[8]\r\n\r\nThe game relies on a day/night cycle that causes meaningful fluctuations in gameplay style. During the day, the player spends most of their time exploring the world; gathering food, firewood, and other items; discovering \"recipes\" to combine available items; and avoiding enemies. With nightfall comes dangerous monsters as well as an invisible menace (Charlie) which attacks the player when the screen is dark. A player must either have a nearby light source or must have some sort of night vision to prevent the night monster from attacking.[5] Crafting, which uses recipes, allows the player to create shelters and weapons like axes.[6] The characters are able to gather and farm plants as well as hunt animals for sustenance, with several characters having dietary perks or restrictions.[8] Food can spoil, however, so the player cannot keep it for too long. Eating spoiled food results in loss of health, sanity, and an increase in hunger.[9] Each in-game day takes 8 minutes of real time.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nWolfgang, an unlockable character, runs from a cadre of giant spiders and their young at dusk.\r\nDeath can occur in a variety of ways. The player has three gauges displayed on the game's heads-up display, which respectively track hunger, health, and sanity. Hunger worsens by default, being replenished with food. Sanity decreases during the dusk and night, or as a result of certain unpleasant actions, such as robbing graves or being in complete darkness; it can be replenished through mentally stimulating activities, such as sleeping, picking flowers, and wearing \"dapper\" clothing. When hunger gets too low, it begins to chip away at health, which will eventually result in the player's death. A large variety of creatures can attack the player,[8] including giant one-eyed birds, tree monsters, tentacles whose owners are not shown,[4] and even small, weak frogs that will nonetheless try to accost the player and steal from them.[5] Additionally, at low enough sanity, figments of the character's imagination become corporeal and able to attack the player. Some creatures, such as pig-like creatures often found in tribes, begin as neutral to the player (Excluding the Reign of Giants character Webber), but the player's actions may lead them to be allies or hostile foes.\r\n\r\nThe game's bulk occurs in Sandbox Mode, but there is a second mode, Adventure, which the player can access by finding a landmark called \"Maxwell's Door.\" Adventure serves as the game's campaign, and consists of five levels that pit the player against Maxwell, the antagonist of Don't Starve. The player loses all items and recipes upon entering, and can only pick four to keep upon completion of each chapter. Death or completion of all five chapters results in being returned intact to Sandbox Mode.[8]"}, {"Name": "Don't Starve Together", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "September 13, 2016", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "T - Teen", "Developers": "\nKlei Entertainment Inc.

The next-generation of fighting has been built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and XBOX ONE by the team behind the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise. \r\n\r\nPowered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, EA SPORTS UFC brings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible. The next-generation of True Player Motion not only showcases the diverse, powerful and fluid of attacks of elite mixed martial artists through Precision Movement, Dynamic Striking and Strategic Submission Battles, but also brings the combatants to life with Full Body Deformation and Real-Time Exertion. The simulation of Human Intelligence takes leaps forward with the strategic and adaptive MMAi system and is expressed through the most realistic characters ever created in a sports game. \r\n\r\nFeel the Fight \u2013 Gameplay Features \r\nStep into the Octagon with the most realistic take on fighting ever achieved. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, every fighter, strike, takedown and submission will make you feel the fight. \r\n\r\n\u2022 MMAi \u2013 A mixed martial artist\u2019s mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fight. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Full Body Deformation \u2013 Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to the Fight Night franchise changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighter\u2019s flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Real-Time Exertion \u2013 A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring mixed martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Fighter Likeness and Facial Animations \u2013 EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. For the first time in an EA SPORTS game, every single licensed athlete in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Precision Movement \u2013 MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Dynamic Striking \u2013 A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Strategic Submission Battles \u2013 To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat. EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Real Damage \u2013 Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day. EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game."}, {"Name": "Earth Defense Force 4.1: The Shadow of New Despair", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "December 8, 2015", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "M - Mature", "Developers": "\nSandlot ", "Publishers": "\nXseed Games ", "Genres": "\nShooter ", "Max Players": "2", "Cooperative": "Yes", "Community Rating": "3.62", "Total View": "4", "Wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Defense_Force#Earth_Defense_Force_2025", "Video Link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxYv9cvvM9U", "Overview": "We knew they were coming.

The game begins with character creation with four classes (Dragon Knight, Nightblade, Sorcerer and Templar). The game consists of three factions with three races each: Aldmeri Dominion (Altmer, Bosmer and Khajiit), Daggerfall Covenant (Breton, Orc and Redguard) and Ebonheart Pact (Argonian, Dunmer and Nord). A tenth race, Imperials, is exclusively available through a collector's edition of the game. Regardless of the chosen option, the story always starts with the character as a prisoner with amnesia in Coldharbour. Just like the other games in the franchise it is set in Tamriel with many ties in the storyline to the other games. It offers the entire continent for players to explore, with a specific region for each of the three factions, and certain regions locked off and saved for future expansions. It is set 1,000 years before The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and circa 800 years before The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. The main antagonist is the Daedric Prince Molag Bal who attempts to fuse Tamriel with Coldharbour through dark anchors. These giant anchors are shot at random intervals, can be seen from a large distance and act as large events similar to those in RIFT.\r\n\r\nThe game does not entirely follow the open environments and storyline from the previous games. Instead, each faction has its own campaign with a linear progress through regions. They consist of elements typical for the series, such as large cities to visit, dungeons, quests, and various characters to talk to. Eventually the campaigns bring the three factions together in the central region of Cyrodiil to join the Alliance War that provides the PvP section of the game. In that area each faction wrestles for territory control, resource nodes and travel routes with its own strongholds. It also emphasizes control over the Elder Scrolls, powerful artifacts that can be stolen and need to be taken to the faction's stronghold, and benefit every member of the faction that holds them. The idea is that power and balance will constantly shift as two factions will work together to retrieve the scrolls from the one that holds them. There are siege weapons to attack strongholds and the highest ranking player of the faction that controls the Ruby Throne in Imperial City is crowned emperor. When fighting for a faction points are earned during scouting or bounty missions that can be used to buy resources for the faction. The game uses a scaling battle system where lower-ranked players can still take on higher level players, starting from level 10.\r\n\r\nOther game elements where players can work together include boss monsters, Delves (mini-dungeons), regular dungeons (for four to twelve players), and Dolmens, a cycling sequence of waves of monsters. Unlike many other MMORPGs players are not divided over separate realms tied to a server, as the game puts all players together in a single environment with dynamic population assignment. Attacking does not rely on auto actions and automatic targeting. Instead, it puts more emphasis on movement (positioning, evading) and free-flowing attacks based on magic, ranged, light and heavy weapons, but there is also a timer system where a cycle of skills is activated automatically. Visual elements show where opponents will strike and this can be used to dodge and evade. During fights up to five skills can be used, along with a special, powerful skill called Ultimate.\r\n\r\nEach character class has three specializations, but separate weapon and armour specialization paths with their own set of passive and active skills. These are further determined by race and guild alignments and like previous games these can eventually open up new lines such as vampire or werewolf. Leveling up is generally done by completing quests, gaining experience and locating skyshards. A new level is awarded with skills points spent in a skill tree. Different resources and recipes are used to craft items."}, {"Name": "The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "June 9, 2015", "Game Type": "", "ESRB": "M - Mature", "Developers": "\nBethesda Softworks ", "Publishers": "\nBethesda Softworks ", "Genres": "\nRole-Playing ", "Max Players": "1", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "4.67", "Total View": "3", "Wikipedia": "", "Video Link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DZxYwQVJYE", "Overview": "Experience one connected world and stay up-to-date with everything your friends are doing in one of the most socially enabled games ever.

It takes place in 10,000 BCE, the beginning of the Mesolithic period. Unlike all previous games in the series no vehicles or modern weapons are available, only melee weapons such as clubs, axes and spears or short-ranged weapons such as bows. There are different types of ammo along with shards that can be used to poison enemies or make them go berserk. All of these need to be crafted by scavenging materials in the game world. Other game elements are learning to create and use fire (also to burn down parts of the environment), and hunting animals for food.\r\n\r\nIt is a time of great peril for the human race and the land is filled with dangerous predators such as sabretooth tigers and woolly mammoths. Animals still alive today such as tigers, leopards, wolves, bears and mountain lions are also present. The player controls Takkar, a member of the Wenja tribe, with the unique ability to tame wild animals. He must rebuild his village and unite the Wenja people against the flesh eating Udam tribe and the masters of fire of the Izila tribe. When the tribe becomes more popular, different types of upgrades for the village become available, tied to important tribe members such as the shaman, the hunter and the warrior. These upgrades then provide new quests, crafting options, and an expanded skill trees, one based on each character.\r\n\r\nThe game has a day-and-night cycle and the tamed animals can be used as companions in various ways, for instance to scout enemy camps, tag enemies, perform takedowns and drop bomb-like objects using the pet owl, riding animals and commanding them to attack. Later on different types of beast tamer masteries can be unlocked to upgrade the animals' abilities. Rebuilding the village is the game's main goal and there is no larger, overarching story beyond that. Returning from the previous game are enemy outposts that need to be captured and then can be used to fast travel, along with locations that have bonfires."}, {"Name": "Far Cry Primal: Collector's Edition", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "February 23, 2016", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "M - Mature", "Developers": "\nUbisoft ", "Publishers": "\nUbisoft ", "Genres": "\nAction, Shooter ", "Max Players": "1", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "3.7", "Total View": "5", "Wikipedia": "", "Video Link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEE18W2W_3k", "Overview": "Set during the savage Stone Age, Far Cry Primal is a full-fledged single player experience that will take gamers to 10,000 BC in history to a time when massive beasts like the woolly mammoth and sabretooth tiger ruled the Earth.

With a dystopian touch democracy has been replaced with a managed democracy. The titular Helldivers are special forces soldiers who go on missions and need to protect Super Earth against three alien races that pose a threat. The war is shown on a large, procedurally generated galactic map. It is divided into three large sections for each of the alien races (Bug, Cyborg and Illuminati). Each section is split up into multiple regions further divided into multiple planets that offer missions. The main goal is to complete a sufficient amount of missions on individual planets to liberate them and eventually gain enough influence to conquer an entire region so the next one can be accessed. When all regions are conquered the alien's home planet can be reached to defeat them completely. The war is a dynamic affair as it is waged on multiple fronts simultaneously and opponents are also able to regain lost sections for instance when a planet is not conquered before time runs out. It is set in a persistent universe where all players worldwide participate and contribute influence to conquer regions. Just like the main universe missions are procedurally generated.\r\n\r\nThe game is played as a twin stick shooter combining movement and aiming and shooting in any direction. The Helldiver is also able to go prone and sprint. There is also a stealth element to the game as enemy troops can alert others and attract a larger opposition. Next to the main weapons, a less powerful side weapon, bombs, grenades and a melee attack can be used. Ammo is scarce and weapons require a manual reload where remaining bullets in the weapon are lost if performed prematurely. The Helldiver can be knocked down and needs some button presses to get up. Stratagems are an important part of the gameplay. They are special abilities that enable a Helldiver to call in equipment, turrets (with friendly fire), mechs, vehicles, decoys, mines, weapons and ammo. They are called in through a radio after deploying a beacon. Similar to the developer's earlier game Magicka they consist of a series of button presses that need to be input correctly. Many Stratagems are unlocked and upgraded gradually, but only a limited amount can be chosen in the loadout.\r\n\r\nMissions are graded with a difficulty level and offer objectives such as destroying buildings, capturing areas, retrieving technology, activate oil extractors, activating and defending launchpads and escort missions. All missions end with a last stand or a final push scenario to be extracted with a shuttle. Missions start aboard the SS Vigilance space ship that acts as the main hub. It has an armory console where the appearance can be changed and weapons and Stratagems can be upgraded. New gear and additional weapons and items are unlocked gradually by gaining experience and leveling up. During missions samples can be collected. These are converted into research points to spend on upgrades. Before starting the mission a dropzone for the hellpod transport can be chosen, but landing closer to the objectives draws more attention. A loadout can be defined through a primary weapon, perks and Stratagems.\r\n\r\nThe game supports cooperative multiplayer for up to four players both offline (not for Vita) and online. Players can coordinate the Stratagems loadout strategically to cover all bases. In multiplayer beacons are also used to redeploy squad members and in the land stand / final push section of each mission at least one Helldiver needs to be extracted. They can also help each other to get up faster, share ammo, help reload and heal each other. Also similar to Magicka friendly fire is always on and cannot be disabled, often leading to chaotic situations. Next to weapon fire, extraction shuttles, deployed vehicles and air drops can damage other players. Multiple Galactic Wars are played in succession as a single one last between one and two months. For instance, the humans (players worldwide) lost the first one to the aliens and Super Earth was overrun.\r\n\r\nThe game was launched worldwide as Helldivers (Limited Edition Bundle) with no regular version available. It is said to be a timed exclusive and it contains the Helldivers: Rangers Pack DLC by default."}, {"Name": "Helldivers Super-Earth Ultimate Edition", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "August 18, 2015", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "T - Teen", "Developers": "\nArrowhead Game Studios ", "Publishers": "\nSony Computer Entertainment ", "Genres": "\nShooter ", "Max Players": "4", "Cooperative": "Yes", "Community Rating": "None", "Total View": "0", "Wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helldivers", "Video Link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Npy7dxY2m4", "Overview": "Helldivers Super-Earth Ultimate Edition includes the full game, Masters of the Galaxy, Turning Up the Heat, and Democracy Strikes Back Expansions, 11 DLC packs, a bonus weapons pack, and a PS4 Dynamic Theme. \r\n\r\nHelldivers is a hardcore, cooperative, twin stick shooter from the creators of Magicka.

Five years have passed since Finn was caught and accused of the series murders, and his admitting to crimes didn't play in his favor. Finn is about to be executed in a couple of days and Felicity goes in for a talk with him only to find herself questioning if he is the real killer.\r\n\r\nThe story now takes turn based entirely on player's choices, it may lead you to believe that Finn really is the killer, or that he was protecting the real killer, or even the player may end up being a primary suspect in the killings. The game is played entirely via smartphone app and requires both PS4 device and your smartphone to be on the same wi-fi network. Upon starting the PS4 game, the smartphone app will be able to join and the player gets to select his name and color which is mostly used to distinguish multiple players when playing competitive mode where each of the players have his/her own hidden agenda to achieve or prevent other players from achieving.\r\n\r\nThe story mode is most suitable for single player who can determine the narration of the entire game by making choices for the two protagonists. Game is paused and resumed via smartphone app only, and as the story progresses new characters, ripple effects, and plot progress get marked which can be checked on the smartphone app. Interaction with the game story is done in several different ways, depending on the scene in question. Most common is the choice you determine for your character, whether it is an action to perform or the way you wish Becky or Felicity to answer to a question being asked. Clue searching scenes prompt you to find 3 on-screen clues within the allotted time which affects story that follows, and quick-time events which are seldom, prompt the player to quickly drag the cursor to a point of interest to make the character pass unobstructed (i.e. not to stumble on a crate while chasing a suspect). And last, the player is sometimes able to shoot at the character on the screen. Doing nothing in either of the interactions or prompted choices is also an option and depending on the situation may even be a good choice.\r\n\r\nKey choices in the game that affect the story in big way are called ripple effects and are marked on the smartphone app. In general, whenever the plot changes, new character info is uncovered, or ripple effect activated, the smartphone app will add it to the logbook for the players to check at any point during gameplay, whether the game is paused or not. The story is split into 3 chapters overall and between each of the chapters all the ripple effects that will affect further story are displayed."}, {"Name": "Hidden Dragon: Legend", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "September 19, 2017", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "M - Mature", "Developers": "\nMegaFun Games ", "Publishers": "\nOasis Games ", "Genres": "\nAction, Platform ", "Max Players": "1", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "3", "Total View": "1", "Wikipedia": "", "Video Link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWlVe629l8Q", "Overview": "Hidden Dragon is 2.5D action platformer taking place in Imperial China, combining classic platform action with fast-paced combo fighting, hearkening back to classics like Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, and Shinobi. \r\n\r\nPowered by the Unreal 4 Engine, Hidden Dragon will make players utilize all their skills in combat, acrobatics, and puzzle-solving to navigate their way through tough enemies, powerful bosses and Metroidvania-style puzzles while building their fighter through an extensive skill tree that allows players to customize their fighting style."}, {"Name": "Hitman GO: Definitive Edition", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "February 23, 2016", "Game Type": "", "ESRB": "", "Developers": "\nSquare Enix ", "Publishers": "\nSquare Enix ", "Genres": "\nPuzzle ", "Max Players": "1", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "4", "Total View": "1", "Wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman_Go", "Video Link": "", "Overview": "Hitman Go is a turn-based puzzle video game developed by Square Enix Montr\u00e9al and published by Square Enix.

The game consists of circa 40 levels divided over five environments. Shown from an isometric-like viewpoint, Lara is guided through swipes. A level is built up through nodes connected by lines. A swipe moves Lara to the next node as long as the path is not obstructed. Puzzle elements appear through obstacles and branching node paths. Levers are used to move platforms and certain path elements are fragile so they can only be crossed a few times before they disappear. Certain levers or switches are only active for a few turns.\r\n\r\nThere are animals (snakes, spiders, lizards ...) and enemies that can move every turn as well and have different movement patterns. Lara can take them out with a gun or a throwable spear, but they often need to be positioned in a certain direction so Lara is not attacked after completing a turn and moving to a node where she is vulnerable. There are also moving traps such as saw blades or rolling boulders that change position with every turn. Unlike Hitman Go that focuses more on stealth, this game is entirely about puzzle-solving and introduces vertical planes with surfaces that can be climbed next to horizontal ones.\r\n\r\nAlong the way Lara can collect hidden gems and fragments that form relics. It is a commercial game with in-app purchases to access the solutions for all levels and additional outfit packs.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.0 (November, 2015) introduced a new chapter - Cave of Fire featuring 11 new levels with harder puzzles, a new gameplay mechanic, new collectible items and so on."}, {"Name": "Laser League", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "May 10, 2018", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "Developers": "\nRolling Media ", "Publishers": "\n505 Games ", "Genres": "\nSports ", "Max Players": "4", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "None", "Total View": "0", "Wikipedia": "", "Video Link": "https://youtu.be/ohNdGyCBqso", "Overview": "aporise the opposition in the light-speed future of sport.\r\n\r\nAn all new multiplayer experience - easy to pick up, but near impossible to put down, Laser League starts as a simple test of your reflexes, but soon becomes a strategic showdown with deep team tactics.\r\n\r\nCombine your class abilities, dominate the pitch, eliminate your opponents and claim your place on the podium.\r\n\r\nBeat Mastery challenges and level up to unlock hundreds of kits and customisations.

The three effects are: destruction (direct damage), control (various status effects that stagger or distract enemies) and mastery (debuff that increases destruction power).\r\n\r\nAlong the three different sigils the player is equipped with a shield that also comes in three flavors: agile (unlimited teleportation, for quick combat), strategic (balanced, with the possibility of blocking attacks) and tactical (focused of blocking attacks). Each shield type offers a reduction in the time to cast a different attack type based on it's specifics.\r\n\r\nThe game also features a basic crafting mechanic where the player can combine different spells in order to produce better variants of the base effect. The system features actions like crafting new spells, upgrading existing spells, retrieving components from previous crafts and even a gambling system for those who wish to test their luck.\r\n\r\nBased on the player's choice of gender, the story is told in a specific way that revolves around the character's personality. The story remains mostly the same but the roles of the two characters are swapped out. The story is rather generic and revolves around the dragon (the spellcaster) and the gryphon (the scout) who seek revenge after the cult of Malthus killed his wife and took her sister."}, {"Name": "Life is Strange", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "January 30, 2015", "Game Type": "", "ESRB": "M - Mature", "Developers": "\nDONTNOD Entertainment ", "Publishers": "\nSquare Enix ", "Genres": "\nAdventure, Life Simulation ", "Max Players": "1", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "4.25", "Total View": "2", "Wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Is_Strange", "Video Link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3YRo48r9ho", "Overview": "Life Is Strange is a graphic adventure, played from a third-person view.[1] Introducing the mechanic of rewinding time allows the player to go back and redo any action other than what is done past a checkpoint (however long a checkpoint lasts).[2] The choices made will alter and affect the story through short, mid or long-term consequences.[3] Dontnod creative director Jean-Maxime Moris added however that \"for each one of your choices that you make there's no definite answer.

The energy meter, first introduced in the previous Mortal Kombat game, allows players to perform techniques such as \"X-Ray\" special moves. Similarly to NetherRealm Studios' previous title, Injustice: Gods Among Us, fighters are able to interact with the environment, bouncing off areas to reposition themselves or using parts of the environment as weapons. In addition, each fighter has three different variations, each featuring a different set of moves they can use during the fight: for example, the character Scorpion features a Ninjutsu variation in which he wields dual swords, a Hellfire variation which relies more on fiery special moves, and an Inferno variation which allows him to summon hellspawn minions to aid him in the fight. The sprint gauge, which was last seen in Mortal Kombat 4/Gold, returns in this game. MKX features two new types of finishing moves: Quitality, which will instantly kill a player's character if they quit during a multiplayer match; and Faction Kills, finishing moves tied to each of the game's five factions. Brutality finishing moves make a comeback from Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 in the form of enhanced versions of certain moves that are triggered when they are used to give the opponent the last attack in a round.\r\n\r\nThe game's play modes include Story, 1 vs. 1 Ranked, King of the Hill, Survivor, and Test Your Luck. A new addition called Living Towers is an evolved form of Mortal Kombat's Challenge Tower where the play conditions will be changing every hour. Another new mode is Faction Wars, where the players will have to choose one from the five factions (Black Dragon, the Brotherhood of Shadow, the Lin Kuei, Special Forces, and White Lotus) to align with and join a persistent online cross-platform competition with the others, winning points for their faction to contribute in the conflict between them, ranking up personally, and earning special rewards such as faction-specific finishing moves if the player's faction win at the end of any given week.\r\n\r\nPlot\r\nTwo years after the defeat of Shao Kahn, Shinnok attacks Earthrealm with his army of Netherrealm forces, including the Earthrealm warriors who were killed during Kahn's invasion and are now resurrected as revenants under Quan Chi's control. After fighting their fallen comrades, a strike team led by Johnny Cage, Sonya Blade, and Kenshi open a portal to Raiden's Sky Temple and head to the Jinsei Chamber, the source of Earthrealm's life force, where Raiden and Fujin are battling Shinnok and his Netherrealm forces. During the fight near the Jinsei, they distract Shinnok long enough for Raiden to steal Shinnok's amulet and imprison him inside it, but Quan Chi escapes. Johnny and Sonya track him to his lair in the Netherrealm and defeat him, successfully restoring Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and Jax to human form, though Quan Chi escapes again. In the years that follow, Johnny and Sonya marry and have a daughter, Cassie, and later divorce. Scorpion reinstates his Shirai Ryu clan while mentoring Kenshi's son Takeda, and Sub-Zero becomes the new Grandmaster of the Lin Kuei after killing Sektor.\r\n\r\nTwenty years after Shinnok's defeat, Johnny assembles a team of fighters composed of Cassie, Takeda, Jax's daughter Jacqui, and Kung Lao's cousin Kung Jin. After undergoing a training exercise with Sub-Zero, they are deployed to Outworld to resolve a civil war between former empress Mileena, who has obtained Shinnok's amulet from Kano, and Outworld's current emperor Kotal Kahn, with whom Earthrealm has a peace treaty. Sonya captures Kano and forces him to reveal Mileena's location. Using this information, Cassie's team aids Kotal in recovering Shinnok's amulet and capturing Mileena, who is subsequently executed on Kotal's orders. No longer believing Earthrealm capable of keeping the amulet safe, Kotal decides to keep it in Outworld's hands, and takes Cassie and her friends hostage as leverage against Raiden. Kotal's second-in-command D'Vorah, who is revealed as a double agent for Quan Chi, steals the amulet. Cassie and her team escape captivity, and inform Earthrealm of D'Vorah's intentions.\r\n\r\nHoping to stop Quan Chi from getting the amulet, Jax and Kenshi, aided by Sareena, lead an assault on the Netherrealm. After fighting his way through the revenants, Jax captures a weakened Quan Chi, who is brought back to Earthrealm and held at an Outworld refugee camp. Scorpion, having learned from Sub-Zero the truth of Quan Chi's involvement in the deaths of his family and clan, infiltrates the refugee camp alongside his clan with the intent of assassinating Quan Chi, defeating Kenshi, Johnny and Sonya in the process. As Scorpion prepares to kill Quan Chi, D'Vorah arrives with the amulet. Quan Chi manages to finish a spell moments before being beheaded by Scorpion, releasing Shinnok from captivity. Weakened by the Shirai Ryu's previous attack, Johnny is taken prisoner by Shinnok and D'Vorah. With the aid of Quan Chi's revenants, Shinnok and D'Vorah assault the Sky Temple, where they subdue Raiden. Shinnok then enters the Jinsei and corrupts it, transforming himself into a powerful demon in the process.\r\n\r\nCassie's team pursues Shinnok, only to be intercepted by Kotal Kahn and his army. They inform him of Shinnok's return and Kotal decides to kill them, hoping to appease Shinnok and buy time to bolster Outworld's defenses, but Sub-Zero and his Lin Kuei comrades appear just in time to repel the Outworld forces. At the Sky Temple, Jacqui and Takeda occupy the revenants, while Cassie and Jin enter the Jinsei chamber. There, Cassie defeats D'Vorah and Shinnok, and rescues her father. A grievously-wounded Raiden then purifies the Jinsei, stripping Shinnok of his powers and forcing the revenants to withdraw. Sonya and her soldiers arrive to take Shinnok and D'Vorah away, and the Cage family reunites.\r\n\r\nSome time later, the revenants Liu Kang and Kitana are revealed to have assumed leadership of the Netherrealm. Raiden, now in possession of Shinnok's amulet and hinted to have been corrupted in the process of purifying the Jinsei, warns them they will face \"fates worse than death\" if they threaten Earthrealm. As a final warning, he presents them with Shinnok's severed, yet still living head."}, {"Name": "Mortal Kombat XL", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "March 1, 2016", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "M - Mature", "Developers": "\nNetherRealm Studios ", "Publishers": "\nWarner Bros Interactive Entertainment ", "Genres": "\nFighting ", "Max Players": "2", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "4.3", "Total View": "5", "Wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_X#Mortal_Kombat_XL", "Video Link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHGwhPyxnTI", "Overview": "One of the best-selling titles of 2015 has gone XL!

In the game's history, around the seventh or eighth centuries a small number of humans took on bestial traits. The majority of humans feared these half breeds and war broke out. Despite the humans outnumbering the half breeds, their animal strength gave them the upper hand in centuries of conflict.\r\n\r\nCenturies later, humanity finds new hope in King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. King Arthur and his like-minded knights take the fight to the half breeds, but Arthur soon realizes it's a losing battle. Through a mysterious turn of fate The Knights discover Black Water, a mystical liquid that significantly extends their lifetimes and gives them remarkable healing abilities. Despite this new advantage the half breeds continue to win battle after battle, until the industrial Revolution turns the tide. Inventors are far ahead of their time, inventing technologies such as thermal imaging, Zeppelins, and wireless communications. New weapons belch electricity, ignite clouds of molten metal on top of enemies, and fulfill dual functions as Fragmentation grenades and proximity mines.\r\n\r\nBy 1886, the war still goes on, but the humans almost have martial law. A new threat emerges in the form of the lower classes rebelling against the rich and the social order, with the Knights supporting the well-to-do upper classes and nobles. The game features four main protagonists from the same squad, who each has a given name, and the adopted name of one of the original Knights. The oldest is Sebastian Mallory, the second to bear the name of Sir Percival, and the descendant of Thomas Mallory, who in the 1400's wrote Le Morte d'Arthur, the definitive Arthurian Text. A close friend of Grayson, he is one of the best Knights in the history of the order.\r\n\r\nGrayson is the third to bear the title of Sir Galahad, and has battled the order's enemies for centuries. He views Mallory as a mentor, Lafayette as a friend, and Isabeau as a potential love interest. Other than that, little is known about him so far. Isabeau D'Argyll is one of the younger Knights in the order, but is much older than her appearance of being in her late twenties. The latest Lady Igraine, Isabeau was Grayson's apprentice and if not for her commitment to the order, his lover. Marquis de Lafayette was a french military officer who fought in the French and American Revolutions. His tactical expertise brought him to the order's attention, and Mallory approached him and convinced him to join the order. Although the group's youngest, his globetrotting has given him a whimsical outlook on life that grounds the squad. As an apprentice, he does not yet bear the name of a Knight."}, {"Name": "Oure", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "October 30, 2017", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "E - Everyone", "Developers": "\nHeavy Spectrum Limited ", "Publishers": "\nHeavy Spectrum Limited, Red Art Games ", "Genres": "\nAdventure ", "Max Players": "1", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "None", "Total View": "0", "Wikipedia": "", "Video Link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVegeo7bFmQ", "Overview": "Oure is an adventure where you explore a fantastic cloudscape dotted with the relics of an ancient civilization. \r\n\r\nAs a unique child born with the powers of the ancient dragons, your parents cast you from the stricken surface into the land above the skies.

For the majority of the game, players need to utilize stealth to avoid hostile encounters, as enemies will kill Amicia instantly if they catch her. Amicia is equipped with a sling which can throw rocks to break chains, create distractions, or stun guards long enough for the rats to ambush them; she can even kill them outright with a headshot. The game is a series of survival puzzles, mostly consisting of methods to scare away or distract the hordes of hungry rats in order to gain access to new areas, or direct them towards enemies. The main method of warding rats off is fire, as rats will seldom enter within a radius of burning torches and braziers. Amicia can also craft special ammunition and supplies, which include fire-starting sulfur stones that ignite braziers, stink bombs that attract rats, or fire suppressants to extinguish torches carried by enemies.

It is a sequel of PlanetSide which originally was released in 2003. Officially announced on July 7, 2011 at the Sony Fan Fair, the second installment used a new game engine, supported thousands of players in continuous large scale conflict, and featured in-game integration with Twitch.tv. As in the first PlanetSide, PlanetSide 2 chronicles the efforts of three factions as they fight for territorial control of the planet Auraxis. PlanetSide 2 was released for the PlayStation 4 in North America on June 23, 2015. PlanetSide 2 holds the Guinness World Record for the biggest first-person shooter battle with 1158 players in a single battle.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAcross the vast continents of Auraxis, players fight in persistent warfare for critical territories and key resources in intense infantry, air and ground vehicle gameplay. Players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their play-style, as well as the needs of their squad, outfit or Empire, building alliances and specialized units to execute acute tactical initiatives and long-term strategic objectives.\r\n\r\nIn PlanetSide 2, when the battles last for days, the fight for territory is more than a victory, its survival.\r\n \r\nKey Features\r\n\r\n-- THREE WARING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three unique Empires \u2013 the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic, the rebellious, freedom-fighter faction New Conglomerate, or the technocratic, alien-influenced Empire Vanu Sovereignty. Each Empire has access to unique weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.\r\n-- MASSIVE WARFARE: With air and ground vehicles slugging it out alongside squads of infantry troops, battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but thousands, all on incredible outsized continent maps of seamless, contestable gameplay space. Whether in open fields, tightly-packed urban centers or enormous outposts, victory requires calculated teamwork and a quick trigger finger to survive the massive battles.\r\n-- PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn\u2019t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions, such as power plants and ammo depots, has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle and provide key rewards and bonuses.\r\n -- CLASSES IN COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match their play-style, as well as the needs of their squad, outfit or Empire. With 6 distinct classes to explore, each combat role, vehicle and weapon has extensive skill trees that will allow players to grow characters laterally, unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, equipment, specialized skills, vehicles, and more.\r\n-- OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Outfits play a very important role in each and every battle. From a small group of specialized soldiers or rapid response team, to a huge clan that can field multiple platoons of hundreds of players, outfits have access to unique customizations\u2013 allowing them to create their own identity and manage their reputation and overall role in the ongoing war."}, {"Name": "Plants vs. Zombies GW2", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "February 23, 2016", "Game Type": "", "ESRB": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "Developers": "\nPopCap Games ", "Publishers": "\nElectronic Arts ", "Genres": "\nShooter ", "Max Players": "2", "Cooperative": "Yes", "Community Rating": "4.08", "Total View": "6", "Wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies:_Garden_Warfare_2", "Video Link": "", "Overview": "Dr. Zomboss, leader of the zombies, has finally taken over the suburbs from the defending plants.

The three protagonists are hard-working Reiana, girly girl Mimi, and tomboy Nyami, (known as the Pop'n Trio), who explore in the Lilycle world, although the three main heroines from \"Lily Lyrical Cycle Rainbow Stage!!!\" and the other 12 girls from the Lilycle drama albums will also show up, sometimes with surprising relationships and pairing. Instead of a single narrator in the story, the player can switch the viewpoint among the narrators, who describe the character's viewpoint. \r\n\r\nThere is also a rhythm game, where the player asssembles a unit of three main characters, consisting of one of the protagonists or one of the girls of Lilycle, whose center effect is applied to the unit, and four other members. The unit also consists of ten back members automatically selected by the game based on their statistics points and a guest idol belonging to another player, who is chosen by the player. Like other rhythm games, the player plays the Live mode as he or she listens to a selected song. Each song is assigned one of four categories: Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Topaz, Garnet, Amethyst, Onyx, Peridot, Alexandrite, and Diamond; the song's category affects the appeal values of all the characters belonging to all categories. During a song, a predetermined sequence of Rhythm Icons scroll from top to bottom towards the target icons in one of five lanes, and the player will tap the target icons as the Rhythm Icons pass over them. In addition, the sequence may also include notes that are continuously held down or flicked in one direction. The player is scored by the timing accuracy of these taps and is given one of five ratings: Awesome, Cool, Fine, OK, Almost. Although the score is not deducted if the player fails to hit a note, the life bar decreases whenever the player misses a note. If the life bar goes down to zero, the song will end early. Scoring is also affected by each idol's skill, which provides different gameplay benefits and are activated automatically at random. The complexity of the song's sequence varies based on the player's selected difficulty for the song as well as its level; there are difficulty levels: Novice, Regular, Advanced, Expert, Master, and Pro from the easiest to the hardest. One of the two additional difficulty levels, Pro+, is available at all events of the game, while the other one, Unlimited, is available for certain songs during special game events. Players are restricted from the number of songs they can play at one time by a stamina gauge, which depletes each time the player plays a song and replenishes over time, when stamina drink items are used, or when unpaid items called Star Gems are used. At the end of each song, a result screen is displayed to player, and his or her performance is rated with a letter grade, a numerical score, and a percentage that represents his or her accuracy.\r\n\r\nIn the side stories, additional sequences that focus on the characters called star communications are made available to the player."}, {"Name": "Portal Knights", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "June 5, 2017", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "Developers": "\nKeen Games ", "Publishers": "\n505 Games ", "Genres": "\n", "Max Players": "1", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "3.5", "Total View": "1", "Wikipedia": "", "Video Link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R4tHAF6txA", "Overview": "Prove yourself a Portal Knight by levelling up your character, crafting epic weapons, and vanquishing foes in real-time in this cooperative, 3D sandbox action RPG.\r\n\r\nExplore dozens of randomly-generated islands!

Just like the original game the player controls the blue character Putty through different levels where he has to free red characters that have been taken prisoner by invading forces. The game is played as a side-scrolling platformer, but at a slower pace with more focus on exploration and puzzle elements to juggle different abilities to reach the captured characters, even though there are many enemies present. To complete a level all other blobs need to be freed and then the area can be exited through a door.\r\n\r\nAs an amorphous blob, Putty has a number of abilities. He can stretch in the four major directions to reach items or move up platforms. He can also jump and flatten himself completely to avoid enemies. He has different types of attacks that can be upgraded throughout the game, ranging from a simple punch to electrical shocks and darts. Not all available abilities are available right away, they are upgraded or become available by collecting stars in levels. There are different types of items and these can be absorbed to use them at a later date. These are restored in a bar on the right side of the screen where they can be selected. Putty can for instance launch rockets, throw bombs, activate a shield, or call in a pod that provides free movement anywhere in the level for 30 seconds. He is also able to inflate and then use an hot air stream to scale heights, but only for a limited amount of time.\r\n\r\nHe has a limited amount of lives and a number of hearts per life. Optionally players can collect all yellow stars in a level. Each level has a time limit and time can be extended by freeing prisoners and collecting clock items. At any moment a map mode can be activated where the game zooms on out to show the entire level. Levels are selected from a global map screen where they are unlocked gradually. The main game mode is called marathon and there is a separate challenge mode for speedruns and other challenges with medals when certain conditions are met. There is also a tutorial available. By playing well players unlock stickers in a sticker book. When all stickers on a single page are unlocked, an additional level becomes available.\r\n\r\nFor the PS4 version preordering the game also provided all levels from the first game Putty."}, {"Name": "Puyo Puyo Tetris", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "December 4, 2014", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "Developers": "\nSonic Team ", "Publishers": "\nSega ", "Genres": "\nPuzzle ", "Max Players": "4", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "5", "Total View": "1", "Wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyo_Puyo_Tetris", "Video Link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWKKjK-NWFg", "Overview": "What happens when two classic puzzle games collide?

It consists of five episodes released between 26th February 2015 and 22nd March 2016 (PC). For the PS4 all episodes were made available simultaneously on 22nd March 2016, as a single game. This version is also informally called R\u00e9publique: Remastered because it is an enhanced version of a game that was first released exclusively on mobile devices, also in episodic format. Following the third episode Ones and Zeroes, the release of the next episodes was put briefly on hold for development of the PC version and the remaining two episodes were then released at different dates, but simultaneously for mobile and PC. For the platforms listed here, unlike the mobile versions, the episodes are not available separately and need to be bought as a single purchase. The five episodes are:\r\nR\u00e9publique: Episode 1 - Exordium\r\nR\u00e9publique: Episode 2 - Metamorphosis\r\nR\u00e9publique: Episode 3 - Ones and Zeroes\r\nR\u00e9publique: Episode 4 - God's Acre\r\nR\u00e9publique: Episode 5 - Terminus\r\nThe game is set in unnamed totalitarian state. The protagonist, a girl called Hope, is a Pre-Cal, someone who was born and raised in a facility that acts as a micronation and where most of the game takes place. Hope's facility is called Metamorphosis and it is led by the Overseer called Kenichiro Treglazov and his soldiers called the Prizrak. The location is used to perform experiments on the Pre-Cals, who grow up there and have never seen the outside world. The player does not control Hope directly, but instead she contacts the player through her phone. She asks for help because a defaced manifesto was found in her room and many people believe she now needs to be \"re-calibrated\", which will erase her personality. She wants to escape and since the totalitarian state is modeled after George Orwell's 1984 the place is swamped with cameras the player can take over to follow and help Hope. You can quickly hop between different cameras, tamper with security devices, lock or unlock doors, provide distractions and so on. Contrary to a game like The Experiment with a similar concept Hope can be controlled directly and does not act on her own. She is also aware of the player's presence and often communicates, even though it is not possible to speak to her directly. You receive assistance from Frederick Cooper, someone who works in the facility and only communicates through a phone as well, using text to speech. Other important characters are Hope's caretaker Mireille Prideaux and the deceased revolutionary Daniel Markus Zager who has left behind audio logs scattered around the facility. Important themes are the totalitarian state, privacy, mass surveillance, technology, media manipulation, genetic manipulation and DNA encoding, and exercising control over people's minds and thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe game was initially designed for mobile devices and then adapted for the controls on PC and console. Through Hope's phone the player can access almost any electrical device in the network. Cameras appear as eyes on the screen and it is possible to quickly move between them, scouting ahead and even in places beyond walls Hope cannot access yet. Once controlling a camera it is possible to rotate and zoom. From this position you can click or use a button to steer Hope in a certain direction. The icon changes colour to show if she walks regularly, seeks cover or makes too much noise and can attract guards. The Prizrak can be temporarily disabled using P-Zero pepper spray or for a longer time using a taser or a sleep mine, but they come in a limited supply and guards eventually wake up again as there are no lethal means. When alerted if often takes a while before they resume their regular patrols. There is no health system and if Hope is captured the game is not over; she is locked up again, but the player can always free her once more with the only downside that all contraband items need to be recovered, from the Prizrak who discovered her, using a pickpocketing mechanic. In later episodes guards have more complex movement and awareness patterns, and come in different types based on their resistance to some of Hope's defence mechanisms.\r\n\r\nAt any time OMNI View can be activated, which pauses the game and launches a hacking interface as an overlay. Characters are highlighted as well as items that can be interacted with. From the interface a map of the facility can be accessed, Hope can be located, all collected data and contraband can be browsed, items can be checked in the inventory and the next objective can be reviewed. Because of the limited signal of the phone the player cannot hop through the facility without Hope nearby. When moving too far from her, the signal becomes weak and it is not possible to progress. Using OMNI View different types of items can be examined or gathered, such as the personal information of the Prizrak, tutorial posters, newspapers and general intel. Using abilities acquired later on it is also possible to hack and listen to voice messages, read e-mail, watch video footage, infiltrate in computers worldwide, use voice and fingerprint scans, lock and unlock doors, set off electrical devices as distractions, disable lasers, review patrol routes, slow down the reaction of guards, view guards through walls using X-Ray and so on. This is also used to find out about hidden locations or pin codes. Hope can also be directed to pickpocket guards to receive more pepper spray or collectible items. These can often be found in the environment as well and include floppy disks advertising independent PC and console games (replacing the Atari-like cartridges advertising mobile games of the mobile versions), a selection of banned, subversive books and tapes left behind by the revolutionary Zager that can only be played in a specific location. When using OMNI View items are colour coded, with green for collectible items, yellow for intel, a different green for cameras, red for doors and so on. Single-use screwdrivers can be used to get through events. Sometimes there are small puzzle-solving elements, often based on interpreting clues.\r\n\r\nThe game focuses entirely on stealth as there is no combat; Hope can only defend herself briefly using a taser, pepper spray or sleep mines. She can sneak around, use cover, and hide in lockers and bushes or behind objects. The advanced hacking techniques however drain her phone's battery. The player can only use them now and then as often recharge points need to be found. Basic actions such as switching between cameras or opening basic doors do not reduce the battery. Replacement batteries can be carried along for a single use as items in an inventory. The game also has Metroidvania elements based on certain abilities and the version of the OMNI software. Intel can be traded with a Data Broker by scanning them at specific computers. Credits are provided in return, used to unlock abilities such as hacking e-mails and voicemail, hacking guards to briefly see their patrol routes, pinging guards to see them on the map and distracting guards by hacking devices, such as turning on an alarm clock or starting a coffee machine. Backtracking is often possible to use new abilities in previous locations. The same goes for the level of the OMNI software. It starts with level one, but there are many doors and lockers that require a clearance for level 2, 3, 4 or 5, meaning they can only be opened by revisiting them in later episodes when the software has been upgraded. For instance, by the end of episode three the software will be at level four, also providing extended battery capacity with every upgrade. The later episodes always offer a way back to the previous locations and at the end of the first episode there is a checkpoint to continue exploring at any time.

The game features Ethan as the entirely new protagonist not seen in any of the previous Resident Evil titles. He arrives to a farm house in rural part of Louisiana in search of his missing wife, Mia. His wife disappeared several years ago without a trace, and his only clue was a video file of her he has on computer telling him that if he ever sees that message, that he should stay the hell away from here and forget about her. What man could just give up on his wife so easily... Ethan definitely isn't the one to accept the current situation and has come looking for her wife and doesn't plan to return without her... or the truth behind her disappearance.\r\n\r\nWhile the game progressively introduces more weapons and increases level of action as the story progresses, it starts with protagonist in a fairly helpless situation seeing how main foes cannot be killed so easily, and when they are killed, they don't stay dead for long. Ethan will find himself running for his life or trying to hide in order to save the bullets for when he may really need them. The inventory size is limited and can be increased by collecting additional backpacks, and items cannot be dropped anywhere to be collected later. Instead, there are various item boxes around the map, mostly in save rooms near the tape recorders which are used to save game progress, where player can store and retrieve items (the boxes are all \"magically\" connected, so stored item in one box can be retrieved from another). There are four weapon slots for quick change, while the rest of the slots are just for holding items. Healing items have their own configured button which uses healing items in order of lower healing property (if you have small and big healing potions, small one will be used first). The game is not paused while using inventory, and it doing so in a dangerous area, enemy can attack you while you're in the middle of it.\r\n\r\nEthan arrives at a farm in Louisiana on a trail of his wife, and before too long he finds clues that his wife was or still is in the vicinity. But she does not seem to be herself anymore which she painfully demonstrates on him. Whatever she and the family that still lives on the farm are now, Ethan is still mere mortal who can feel severed limbs or being stabbed. However, the liquid substance used for healing seems to solve that problem for him if used in time. The game was built for VR from the get going so it can be played entirely in VR mode or regular 2D mode on a TV or monitor. The VR mode sacrifices resolution for level of realism and uses headset for aiming (your character automatically aims at the point you are looking at). In VR mode, character's hands are also shown a bit more than just seeing fists holding a weapon which additionally adds to a level of realism. Going back to the origins of Resident Evil games, rooms were connected by doors which serve as loading screen animation between rooms, not showing you what is in the other room. This game does the same (apart from loading) in a way that when you open some door, you don't see through it but picture starts to appear after you pass through, so one may never know who or what awaits behind the door.\r\n\r\nRE7 is as much horror as it is survival, boosting up scare elements and minimizing downright shooting action which offers normal and hard difficulty, while unlocking nightmare difficulty level upon completing the game. For the big part of the first half it seems more like a game from Silent Hill franchise, but as you move toward the ending it all starts to make sense and Resident Evil franchise starts to become apparent again, leaving any questions (i.e. what happened to Zoe, how does Chris Redfield play into all this, where did Lucas go, etc.) to be answered in story-based DLCs. The game uses auto-save feature, but also supports manual saves in save rooms at the audio recorders. There is no need for save-game material like using ink ribbon to save at typewriter in earlier RE titles. Japanese release of the game has some gore tuned down heavily and has been released as regular (gore-less) and grotesque version. However, even grotesque version release is not fully uncensored and still has some key elements removed or tuned down in comparison to US or European releases."}, {"Name": "RESIDENT EVIL 7: Biohazard: Gold Edition", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "December 12, 2017", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "M - Mature", "Developers": "\nCapcom ", "Publishers": "\nCapcom ", "Genres": "\nHorror, Shooter ", "Max Players": "1", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "4.75", "Total View": "4", "Wikipedia": "https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_7:_Biohazard", "Video Link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kebTCrZn7wQ", "Overview": "Experience one of the scariest, most highly acclaimed games of 2017 with Resident Evil 7 Gold Edition - complete with all Season Pass content.

The player controls a yellow blob with a beady eye that can jump around and cling to walls similar to Super Meat Boy. It is however able to always stick to walls permanently and also hang upside down. Next to movement, controls include jumping, speed up, and unstick. The goal in the game to complete levels based on platform jumping challenges and avoid all red elements in the environment.\r\n\r\nThe twist is that all levels are built up around soundtracks by famous musicians. Levels starts with a very basic sound, but when the character moves through it notes can be collected that open up more elements of the soundtrack. The animation and level design is changed dynamically to pick up on all the musical elements. Some of these are merely aesthetic, but other influence the fundamentals of the environment. A certain sound causes an element to glow, bumping the character. A vocal sound can provide a temporary platform until is no longer sung, a large bass can fill up the environment with a mountain of red etc. Elements from the lyrics are also used. For instance when the word \"turn\" is sung, it can cause an element to turn, and \"break\" causes an element to fall apart. As more notes are collected, the later parts of levels get progressively harder because of the amount of elements to take into account. Threats and opportunities become apparent through sound to determine the timing of actions, rather than only relying on the visual elements. When dead because of a red element, the character immediately respawns. There are checkpoints to save progress. It also incorporates puzzle elements where items can be moved around and platforms can be manipulated.\r\n\r\nThe main campaign consists of five albums with three to five levels each. Environments often have a different theme adapted to the general atmosphere of a song. Some of these are city rooftops, a factory, an office, an 8-bit dream world, a frozen wasteland, piloting a spaceship or swimming through water. The artists contributing songs include Beck, deadmau5, I Am Robot and Proud, and Jim Guthrie. Songs are not entirely linear; they are based on variations of arrangements and often different for each game session. Additional game modes are included after completing the game. These include Death Mode where a certain amount of coins needs to be picked up with a time limit in each level, and Beat School where a sequence of beats needs to be recreated.\r\n\r\nPlayers can create custom levels through the Edit mode. It offers a grid-based music sequencer that also acts as a level editor. Included parameters are tempo, key and scale type. For the Vita the touch pad can be used to place items in the sequencer. All art and audio assets from the game are available to remix and mash up. Levels can be shared with other players and downloaded from a central community hub. Further assets such as sound and terrain packs are available through an in-game music shop as commercial DLC.

BaraBariBall favors responsive controls, improvisation and tactics, and currently features three unique characters with a wide variety of attacks and special abilities.\r\n\r\nSuper Pole Riders is an enhanced, extended version of the hit pole-vaulting polo game, Pole Riders, bringing the highly-technical, physics-based controls of the single player game QWOP to a local multiplayer battle. Two athletic men pole-vault into the air to try to kick a ball, suspended on a rope by a pulley, into their enemy's goal. It's a no-holds-barred sport of launching yourself off your opponent's head, kicking him off his pole, and flipping the other guy into orbit with your pole.\r\n\r\nHokra is a minimalist digital sports game.

Unfortunately, only the eldest brother, White, has the mentality and discipline associated with this role, and has no luck getting his younger siblings to take their mission seriously. Black is a self-absorbed slacker, Pink is more concerned about fashion and gossip, Blue sleeps all day, Red is an out-of-control hothead, Yellow is innocent to a fault, Aqua hates violence, and Green is a cunning sneak who uses his status as the baby brother to manipulate his siblings."}, {"Name": "Super Exploding Zoo", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "June 2, 2015", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "Developers": "\nHoneyslug ", "Publishers": "\nHoneyslug ", "Genres": "\nPuzzle ", "Max Players": "1", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "None", "Total View": "0", "Wikipedia": "", "Video Link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULRRgP0Z6vc", "Overview": "Round up herds of exploding animals and rampage around 80 destructible levels - defend your precious egg by slamming your herd into the greedy alien marauders and blowing them up.

He loves his girlfriend Bandage Girl, a girl made of bandages, and Bandage Girl loves Meat Boy. However, nobody loves Dr. Fetus, a fetus in a jar clad in a tuxedo, so Dr. Fetus hates everybody...especially Meat Boy. Dr. Fetus decides to kidnap Bandage Girl, and so Meat Boy must chase after Dr. Fetus and rescue her! Is he a bad enough dude to rescue his girlfriend?\r\n\r\nSuper Meat Boy is a fast-paced scrolling platformer based on the earlier online Flash game Meat Boy. Meat Boy's only abilities are to run, jump, wall jump, and die. As the game's defining feature is its extreme difficulty, he will die a lot. To counteract this, each stage is short -- sometimes only a few seconds, sometimes up to a minute or so -- and upon death the player will immediately be returned to the start for another attempt. If Meat Boy manages to reach Bandage Girl, she is then swept away once more by Dr. Fetus, and the player moves on the next stage. After clearing enough stages in each chapter, the player can then fight the boss of that area, who must be defeated to move on to the next chapter.\r\n\r\nThe game features over 300 stages across seven chapters, including retro-style bonus stages, boss stages, and even higher-difficulty variants of every normal stage in the game. The Xbox 360 release also includes a special chapter called \"Teh Internets\", where the developers can release new level packs free of charge on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nThere are also more than a dozen playable characters making guest appearances from other indie games, including Tim from Braid, the Alien Hominid, and Gish. Characters are unlocked either through retro bonus stages hidden within the normal stages, or by collecting bandages hidden in many of the game's levels. Each version of the game contains a slightly different set of unlockable characters.\r\n\r\nThe player's best times are recorded for each stage and uploaded to a global leaderboard. Also, after completing a stage, a replay is shown that simultaneously displays every single attempt the player made, which can also be saved."}, {"Name": "Super Mega Baseball", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "", "Developers": "\n", "Publishers": "\n", "Genres": "\nSports ", "Max Players": "", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "2.25", "Total View": "2", "Wikipedia": "", "Video Link": "", "Overview": "Tight controls and a smooth learning curve will have you knocking it out of the park in no time in this awesome arcade baseball simulator.

The Ego system offers a fine-grained control of difficulty on a per-user basis, which has been widely praised for leveling the playing field in cooperative and competitive modes. This system will push seasoned gamers to their limits while simultaneously providing a gentle introduction for beginners.\r\nUp-to Four Player Local Co-op Play: In addition to solo play, players can try their hand at head-to-head, 2v1, 2v2 and co-op against the CPU. In co-op mode, teammates alternate batting/running each time at-bat, and alternate pitching/fielding each inning, meaning ballplayers need to be on their toes every play. To even games, players can use the Ego system to set up a competitive game between friends of any skill level.\r\nUltra Responsive and Blazing Fast Gameplay: Controls are easy to learn, but players will need to master jumping, diving, wall-catches, power-swings and cut-off plays to properly dominate friends. Short load times and a streamlined interface means most of the time is spent in the action, with nine-inning games taking around 20 minutes to play.\r\nFull Batting and Pitching Statistics: Most baseball statistics imaginable are available and ballplayers can use these to show off their MVP-quality skills.\r\nLeveling System: Players tally up Starpoints for hits, strikeouts and catches during each game and Level Up once they collect enough points. Players can hire staff to train and coach their squad, improving skill attributes such as Power and Speed. Use that jacked up team to win at higher difficulties (and post higher leaderboard scores than friends)!\r\nPlayer Customization: Customize the look and names of a team\u2019s players to create a ragtag crew of family and friends.

It is an open world game that can be explored on foot or by driving cars, trucks, buses, boats or bikes. Just like in the original game the protagonist, now Marcus Holloway, is a member of the Dedsec hackers collective. The game is now set in San Francisco, Oaklan, Marin and Silicon Valley with a size twice as large as Chicago in the previous game. Again the group goes against the control of ctOS (Central Operating System), now in 2.0 version, as a means to control all of the city as well as to spy on its citizens.\r\n\r\nThere are many famous landmarks in the game with special attention to the Silicon Valley and its many companies and employees which are often the centre of jokes. Many story sequences are presented as cut-scenes. At the start of the game Holloway is not a member of the collective yet. He is identified by ctOS as a potential threat and this leads him to breach the data centre and delete his ctOS profile, which impresses the Dedsec group. The fellow hackers he works with are Horatio, Josh, Sitara and Wrench. The goal is to take down ctOS and its company Blume. They also raise awareness as completing missions is rewarded with followers, people who take notice, as a means to further the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe different missions can often be completed in various ways. Enemies can be approached directly with gunplay, but most assignments encourage the use of stealth and a large amount of technological gadgets often accessed and controlled through Holloway's in-game smartphone. Typical actions include hacking phones for voice and text messages, changing traffic lights, disabling security systems, taking over camera systems, controlling cars, turning junction boxes into proximity mines and so on. The quadrocopter is entirely new as a drone that can be flown to scout locations as often terminals need to be reached with puzzle sections before a hack is successful. Another type of drone is a remote-controlled car can be driven to hack terminals from a remote location. Hacking is also often a means to attack enemies from a distance, for instance by activating cars and driving them into opponents. Marcus has some acrobatic, parkour-like moves to get around.\r\n\r\nAdditional options become available through an upgrade system. There are three categories which fit different playstyles: Agressor, Ghost and Trickster. Holloway is able to issue fake warrants so random citizens are arrested in police actions. He can also lure gangs into wars to make a location less densely populated. When he attracts too much attention himself the police attempts to hunt him down. Money earned during missions can be spent in various ways, for instance by creating weapons through 3D printing. Many side missions and additional information can often be found by snooping on anyone walking around. Cars can be stolen or they are delivered using an phone app. Large distances can also be crossed using a fast travel system. There are optional eKart races, also rewarded with money and followers. Sailing and participating in races is supported as well. Holloway can be customized through a large amount of clothing options.\r\n\r\nThe single-player game morphs seamlessly in a multiplayer environment when there is an online connection. That means that other online players can be encountered at any moment. Players can choose to cooperate and work together on missions or they can hack each other. In the latter called invasions someone installs viruses on another player's system and needs to complete the process and escape. The targeted player can win by locating or killing the hacker in the vicinity before time runs out.

Players explore the school collecting items to solve puzzles and advance the story, much in the vein of a classic adventure game. Micro-management of items is key, as the player has limited item slots and some objects may be important for progression despite not being used for hours from the collection point. As the game offers non-linear progression, various documents can be found throughout the school offering additional backstory and hints on how to advance. Likewise, the player can receive text messages through their cell phone which offers clues on plot progression. Holding certain objects in specific sections of the game can trigger unique events and encounters, such as fights with ghosts that otherwise would not have been prompted. Puzzle solutions, such as combinations for locked safes, are randomized on each playthrough. This encompasses a large portion of the gameplay; searching for items and solving puzzles.\r\nThere are no weapons in the game, and thus the protagonist is unable to engage enemies in combat. Therefore, the player must hide from opponents, in a bid to stay alive. If damaged, healing items must be used to restore health, as the game does not feature health regeneration. If health is depleted completely, the player must return to a prior save. Saving can only be accomplished at bulletin boards scattered throughout the school with the use of felt-tip pens, which are limited and must be found around the academy, akin to ink ribbons from the original Resident Evil. Though other characters throughout the title are fully voiced, the protagonist is never heard, and instead communicates with other persons through the use of player-inputted dialogue options. Depending on what is said, conversations and in-game scenarios may change. The title features eight different endings, and the end result achieved is dictated by these decisions made during conversations with story characters. Similarly, the difficulty selected when starting a new playthrough affects gameplay. Easier difficulties offer more items, progression hints and less paranormal encounters, whilst the harder ones include fewer items and hints, more difficult encounters, exclusive enemies and more frequent scares. On hard and above for example, the player's phone has no signal, thus eliminating the aforementioned text message clues."}, {"Name": "Wild Guns Reloaded", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "December 20, 2016", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "Developers": "\nNatsume Atari ", "Publishers": "\nNatsume ", "Genres": "\nShooter ", "Max Players": "4", "Cooperative": "Yes", "Community Rating": "None", "Total View": "0", "Wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Guns#Reloaded", "Video Link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtNgD4JuQ-E", "Overview": "Wild Guns Reloaded is a fast-paced arcade-style shooter, mixing the Wild West with steampunk.

The player progresses by solving puzzles which are based on interactions with mazes presented on panels around the island, though the rules and outcomes of solving the individual mazes are part of the puzzles that the player will have to come to learn themselves through both visual clues around the island and through audio logs that the player can find.

The full game is free to download and play and does not require PlayStation Plus subscription, only a PSN account to download it and play it online.\r\n\r\nThe game features over 350 different tanks from five different classes (light tank, medium tank, heavy tank, tank destroyer, and artillery) and seven nations (USA, Germany, UK, USSR, France, Japan, and China) and supports 30-player online mode pitting 15 against 15 players. PlayStation 4 release features new content that was not previously available on PC or Xbox 360/One releases, some of which include custom maps, custom tanks, and custom vehicle skins.\r\n\r\nThe launch for PlayStation 4 platform, however, started with around 130 tanks from only three nations (USA, Germany, and USSR) with the rest being gradually added. Beta exclusive US tanks which can be found in one's Garage include T1E6-PS with elite camouflage and M22 Locust-PS adorned with a color scheme of the original PlayStation console. PlayStation Plus subscribers will additionally get access to an exclusive German premium tank, Pz.Kpfw. II Ausf. J PS adorned with a unique darkened camouflage featuring a \"pinup girl\" livery.\r\n\r\nLaunch release also features these two time-exclusive multiplayer maps:\r\nSkorpion Pass - set in North Africa during WWII, at the time of release this is the largest map created for the game\r\nRuinberg - set in war-torn European town better suited for urban warfare, with fields that allow for outmaneuvering enemy tanks\r\nThe console version of World of Tanks feels like a completely different game in comparison to PC version. Aside from various aesthetic designs, different settings and presentation, same and different maps, things worth mentioning include:\r\nConsole version doesn't have separate download releases per regions and during startup player can connect to either US, European, or Asian server. This in turn also means the same Hall of Fame ladder on the Internet features all players independent on the region (while PC one has different for Europe, US, etc.).\r\nWhen creating Platoon to play with other players on the same team, console version supports up to 5 players in a platoon, while PC only 3 (PC, does however, include an option to create a platoon during actual gameplay by prompting another player to join your platoon).\r\nPC version allows upgrade of individual tank element (turret, caterpillar, cannon, engine, and radio) while console version has pre-set packages that are researched and purchased which include several of those elements at once and don't offer individual element upgrade.\r\nWhile PC version relies on keyboard and allows players to type to their platoon, team, or even enemy players, console version relies on a bunch of pre-set messages (some of which are also available on PC version), the chat is available in both version though there are differences.\r\nConsole version has only 1 crewman per tank, while on PC version that is branched out into driver, loader, gunner, etc., and the number of crew depends on the type of tank. Also, not all crew are compatible with all vehicle types, while on console version vehicle type doesn't matter, only nationality (i.e. German crewman can only be assigned to a German tank).\r\nAiming at enemy tank on a console version outlines the tank based on where you're aiming at, telling you how big of a chance is for penetration of that area if you land a successful hit, while PC version just generally outlines a tank in green and doesn't show you whether you're bullet will bounce off or if you have a chance to penetrate its armor.\r\nAiming an artillery on PC just shows a trajectory line, but on console it shows the time that bullet will travel to that place which can be as high as 3-4 seconds on larger distances which plays a huge factor when enemy tank isn't completely static."}, {"Name": "Worms Battlegrounds", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "May 30, 2014", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "Developers": "\nTeam 17 ", "Publishers": "\nTeam17 Digital Ltd.

Legacy of the Duelist is a 2015 simulated card game based off the Yu-Gi-Oh! Franchise. The first Yu-Gi-Oh! game to be played on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Legacy of the Duelist features over 6,600 playable cards and 90 characters, the most of any previous installment. The game allows you to play in various game modes all which require you to create powerful decks filled with monsters, magic and trap cards in order to defeat your opponent in battle. The story campaign of Legacy of the Duelist allows you to relive popular battles between characters in the Yu-Gi-Oh! anime. You begin by choosing one of the Yu-Gi-Oh! shows (Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds, Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL, Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V) and then following in chronological order of the TV show you begin to duel numerous characters. Each victory against the opponent rewards you with 3 cards from the opposite deck, a deck recipe so you can recreate the opponents deck, and Duel Points (DP). DP are used in the card shop to purchase any one of the 24 booster packs in game. Once you complete any story mission the game allows you to participate in a Reverse Duel where you take control of your opponents deck and battle with it. Completing and winning in all of a characters duel will unlock a challenge deck; allowing you to face that character in a match of better cards and higher difficulty. Battle Pack mode contains both Draft Play and Sealed Play. In Battle Pack mode, the player begins by purchasing one of the three Battle Packs in game: Epic Dawn, War of the Giants and War of the Giants - Round 2. Then, if playing in Draft Play, the player is given 3 rounds to draft cards in order to create a 40 card deck. Sealed mode will automatically create the deck for you. Afterwards the player takes their newly created deck and uses it online to battle other players. Completing a match with 3 wins (or 3 losses), will give you the option to add those cards into your card trunk. The online component of the game allows you to duel against players from around the world. You can play in both Ranked and Unranked matches and each have different rules. Legacy of the Duelist adheres to the banlist of the physical card game. This means that certain cards deemed too powerful have been either completely banned or limited to 1-2 copies during duels by Konami. Playing online with Unranked rules allows you to ignore the banlist and use any cards you want in your deck. Meanwhile playing in Ranked will do the opposite and you prevent you from using the banned cards in gameplay. The game also features trophies and achievements, and the paid DLC allows you to purchase a story battle, reverse battle, and obtain special custom recipes not in game."}, {"Name": "Zen Pinball 2", "Platform": "Sony Playstation 4", "Release Date": "December 24, 2013", "Game Type": "Released", "ESRB": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "Developers": "\nZen Studios ", "Publishers": "\nZen Studios ", "Genres": "\nAction ", "Max Players": "4", "Cooperative": "No", "Community Rating": "None", "Total View": "0", "Wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Pinball_2", "Video Link": "https://youtu.be/FFBlrc8D1z0", "Overview": "Zen Pinball 2 is the sequel to Zen Pinball, the equivalent of the Pinball FX games on Xbox and PC.

The game is set in London, England, and the player controls a random survivor of a zombie apocalypse and starts in a metro station. Next to surviving, the protagonist is also after a cure to combat the outbreak, which was first predicted 400 years earlier as The Black Prophecy by John Dee, an astronomer and adviser to the queen. A secret society known as the 'Ravens of Dee' researched his predictions and worked towards finding a cure. The members hide in a bunker and one is chosen by the Raven leader Sondra to confront the zombies. The spiritual leader is called Prepper and assists the character through radio during missions by providing hints and overlooking the situation when the character manages to restore the power to the CCTV cameras. When those are online, Prepper can draw maps of the surroundings that are displayed on the GamePad. Meanwhile, Dr. Knight, one of the Queen's doctors, also searches for the cure as a panacea under Buckingham Palace.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist explores different locations, needs to take out zombies, and collects items and weapons. True to the spirit of survival horror, it features a form of permadeath. If the character becomes killed or infected, which is possible with a single bite, he slowly turns into a zombie and if no medicine to combat it is found, another character from the bunker is sent out to continue the mission, but without the gathered items or weapons. In the hardcore Survival mode the consequences are fiercer as the entire campaign needs to be restarted with no option to revert back to an earlier point. Basic items when starting are a flashlight, a gun, some ammo and a cricket bat. Ammo is scarce and needs to be spent wisely. In most situations riskier melee weapons are used to save the firearms for the most difficult encounters. Even then, only head shots are effective. It is however possible to track down the former protagonist and kill it to reclaim the inventory. Next to the basic items there are also medicine, grenades, molotov cocktails and wooden planks to barricade doors. Barricading doors and hacking combinations locks is done in context-sensitive situations through the GamePad's touchscreen. In other situations it displays the mini-map (when available), and it is used as a sniper scope or to manage the inventory. Additional items can be stored in the home base. The device's gyroscope is used to scan the environment by holding the left trigger. The GamePad is held up towards the TV and acts as a scanner to view the surroundings, even through walls. At those moment the game turns to a fixed third-person view where the character remains vulnerable. Discovered items in unexplored rooms through scans are stored on the mini-map to help locate them.\r\n\r\nAttacking requires a careful approach. When fighting with the bat for instance, holding the left trigger is used to block, and to attack the right trigger needs to be held. Once released, the bat is swung. If the right one is held too long, the character becomes tired with the raised arm and lowers it again. As the movement is slow, it requires precise timing during fights and only a small amount of zombies can be attacked that way at once. The right trigger is also used to shake off zombies. They generally leave the character alone when no sound is made or when he has not been spotted. Therefore most situations require the isolation of zombies from larger groups. When the Miiverse is enabled, other players' characters can appear as zombies in the game, and clues or hint tagged on walls can be seen by other players in their games.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer is available for two players and only offline. One player uses the GamePad and is King Boris, king of the zombies. The environment is shown using a top-down view of the entire level and the king can put zombies in the game while the other player uses a standard controller (Wii Remote with Nunchuk or Pro Controller) to complete the levels. The asymmetric multiplayer is organized around three game modes and five maps, but with the same type of gameplay, including elements of capture-the-flag and domination game types.\r\n\r\nThe later released ports for other platforms work without the above described inclusion of the Wii U GamePad. All special gimmicks like the scan function are either triggered with a button press or are otherwise integrated into the UI, e.g. the map is displayed in the lower right corner of the screen.
